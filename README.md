# Mini Googlebot  
Simulation of a data-gathering algorithm created by Google called "Googlebot" using C, which searches the web for URLs that redirect to websites. As a result, it gathers a dataset of each website, allowing Google's search Algorithm to decide its relevance to the user. This project aims to utilize the correct data structures in order to store and process data in a efficient manner.

## Data Structure Usage and Implementation Justification
We decided to utilized the concept of Simple Linked List to implement an ADT to store the websites. That is because ...

## Tools, Development Model and Presentation
This project is developed using the C language, according to the C99 pattern.
### Observation
These pieces of information must be read on a .txt file named "googlebot.txt", following the CSV format (*Comma Separated Value*) - meaning that all the data on a website is separated using commas. Here's an example:
```
0001,YouTube,900,https://www.youtube.com/,youtube,videos,online
0002,Netflix,800,https://www.netflix.com/br/,netflix,videos,streaming
```

  * **Insert a website**
  *  **Remove a website**
  * **Insert primary-key**
  * **Update Relevance**
  * **Exit**
