# Mini Googlebot  
Simulation of a data-gathering algorithm created by Google called "Googlebot" using C, which searches the web for URLs that redirect to websites. As a result, it gathers a dataset of each website, allowing Google's search Algorithm to decide its relevance to the user. This project aims to utilize the correct data structures in order to store and process data in a efficient manner.

## Compiler/Plataform Used

## User Manual

## Data Structure Usage and Implementation Justification


### Observation
These pieces of information must be read on a .txt file named "googlebot.txt", following the CSV format (*Comma Separated Value*) - meaning that all the data on a website is separated using commas. Here's a example:
```
0001,YouTube,900,https://www.youtube.com/,youtube,videos,online
0002,Netflix,800, https://www.netflix.com/br/,netflix,videos,streaming
```
### Project's features
When executed,  the programme must show the following options:
* **Insert a website**
*  **Remove a website**
* **Insert primary-key**
* **Update Relevance**
* **Exit**

## Tools, Development Model and Presentation
This project is developed using the C language, according to the C99 pattern.
